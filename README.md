## Commonly Asked Concepts
Here are some key terms and concepts that are commonly covered on the Microsoft AI-900 exam:

- Artificial Intelligence (AI) – The simulation of human intelligence processes by computer systems, including learning, reasoning, and self-correction.
- Machine Learning (ML) – A subset of AI that involves training models on large datasets to make predictions or classifications without being explicitly programmed.
- Deep Learning – A special type of machine learning that uses layered neural networks to study and sort data.
- Natural Language Processing (NLP) – The ability of computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language.
- Computer Vision – The ability of computers to analyze and interpret visual data, such as images and videos.
- Azure AI services – A suite of services and tools provided by Microsoft Azure for building and deploying AI and ML solutions, including Azure Machine Learning, Azure Cognitive Services, and more.
- Data Science – A multidisciplinary field that involves using statistical and computational methods to extract insights and knowledge from data.
- Understand Data preprocessing – The process of cleaning and preparing data before it can be used for analysis or modeling.
- Data labelling – The process of annotating data with labels or tags to enable supervised learning.
- Model evaluation – The process of assessing the accuracy and performance of machine learning models.
- Overfitting – In machine learning, there’s a frequent issue when a model is too complicated and closely follows the training data, leading to a not-so-great performance on fresh data.
- Deployment – The process of deploying machine learning models to production environments or integrating them with other applications.
- Ethics and responsible AI – The importance of ethical considerations when developing and deploying AI solutions, such as transparency, fairness, and privacy.
- Explainable AI – The ability of AI systems to provide clear explanations of their decision-making processes and recommendations.
